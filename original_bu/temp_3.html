           <h2> Pain au Levain</h2>

           <em> Organic unbleached wheat flour, organic whole wheat flour, whole wheat starter, sea salt, and malted barley flour...</em>
          <p>A sourdough that contains about 20% whole wheat flour. 'Levain' also refers to the particular whole wheat sourdough starter used in this and other loaves we make. What distinguishes this loaf from other sourdoughs is its particularly strong smokey' crust and its chewy lighter interior crumb speckled with whole wheat. Pictured to the right are the small, large and 'long' levain along with levain rolls. We also make a version of levain that contains 3/4 whole what flour that is a bit denser than the orignal. The loaves take nearly 24 hours to makefrom start to finish and are used as table bread at many Bay Area restaurants.</p></td>
